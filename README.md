# 💰 AI Value Translator

An AI-powered tool that translates qualitative business problems into quantitative financial ROI.

## 🚀 About the Project
Sales and Customer Success teams often struggle to justify the price of software because they can't prove the "Business Value" mathematically. This tool solves that by:
1.  **Translating** unstructured complaints (e.g., "My team is burning out") into specific operational inefficiencies.
2.  **Mapping** those inefficiencies to standard variables (e.g., Hourly Wage, Time Wasted).
3.  **Calculating** the projected annual savings.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python)
* **AI Logic:** Google Gemini API (Free Tier)
* **Hosting:** Streamlit Community Cloud

## 🔮 Roadmap
* [ ] Connect to Gemini API for dynamic variable guessing.
* [ ] Add a PDF export for the "Business Case" report.
